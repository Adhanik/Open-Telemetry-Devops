The error youâ€™re encountering is due to an issue with your **DynamoDB table schema**. Terraform expects the **primary key of the DynamoDB table** to be named **`LockID`** (case-sensitive), and it must be a string (`S`).  

### **Issue:**
Your **DynamoDB table definition** in Terraform is missing a proper primary key setup. The error message:
```
ValidationException: One or more parameter values were invalid: Missing the key LockId in the item
```
suggests that the `LockId` attribute is either missing or misconfigured.

---

### **Fix: Update Your DynamoDB Table Configuration**
Modify your **DynamoDB table resource** to include the `LockId` as the primary key properly.

#### **Corrected DynamoDB Table Definition:**
```hcl
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "basic-dynamodb-table" {
  name           = "amit-terraform-state-locks"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key       = "LockID"  # <-- Ensure "LockID" matches exactly (case-sensitive)

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"  # <-- Make sure this matches `hash_key`
    type = "S"  
  }
}
```

---

### **Why This Fix Works**
- **Terraform's backend locking mechanism** requires a DynamoDB table with a **primary key** named exactly `LockID` (not `LockId`).
- **Your previous table definition used `LockId` instead of `LockID`**, causing Terraform to fail when trying to acquire a lock.

---

### **Steps to Apply Fix**
1. **Destroy the incorrect DynamoDB table** (optional but recommended to avoid conflicts):
   ```bash
   terraform state rm aws_dynamodb_table.basic-dynamodb-table
   terraform apply
   ```
2. **Update your `terraform` backend block to match the correct table name and key:**
   ```hcl
   backend "s3" {
     bucket         = "amit-eks-state-bucket-tf"
     key            = "terraform.tfstate"
     region         = "us-east-1"
     dynamodb_table = "amit-terraform-state-locks"  # This remains unchanged
     encrypt        = true
   }
   ```
3. **Reapply Terraform:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

After making this change, Terraform should be able to acquire the state lock successfully. ðŸš€
